## Test-Instructions:
### First, you will need to run your schema.sql file in MySQL, then ensure you are using the ecommerce_db database. Once in the correct database, run "npm run seed" to insert the data into your database. If all seeds pass and no error is returned, run "npm start" in your command line to start the program. You will then need to switch into Insomnia and enter localhost:3001/api/categories. All test for categories can be run using this link in Insomnia. All ests for products can be run using localhost:3001/api/products, and all tests for tags can be run using localhost:3001/api/tags.
